<p>The image contains the logo of Lidl, which is a supermarket chain
known for its low prices. The logo itself does not specify any
particular product on sale or offer; rather, it represents the brand
identity of the company. Since there is no text present within the logo
that indicates a specific product or promotion, and considering the CZK
currency symbol in the image, it can be inferred that the image is
likely related to a sale or discount being offered at Lidl stores.
However, without additional context or information outside of this
image, it’s not possible to determine which products are on sale or what
the exact nature of the promotion might be.</p>

<p>The image shows a section of a supermarket advertisement for various
food products. The top part of the ad features a large red banner with
white text that reads “OD ČTVRTKA 24.4. I DO NEDEŁE 27.4.” This suggests
that the sale is taking place from October 24th to November 27th.</p>
<p>Below this banner, there are several products on display with their
prices and descriptions. The first product is a large block of pink meat
labeled “Mlete maso mix,” which is priced at 139.90 CZK. This indicates
that the meat is likely to be a type of ground or minced meat, possibly
chicken or turkey, given its color and texture.</p>
<p>The second product is a jar of “Krúti/kuřeci maso,” which is priced
at 48.90 CZK. This suggests that the contents are a mixture of herbs and
spices for seasoning meat, possibly including garlic or onion as well.
The jar is labeled with “280 g, maso z horních stehen, 1 kg = 174.64
Kč,” indicating that the product weighs 280 grams and costs 174.64 CZK
per kilogram.</p>
<p>The third product is a block of “Máslo” with a price tag of 38.90
CZK, which translates to “Butter.” The description on the packaging
mentions that it contains “250 g, 1 kg = 155.60 Kč,” indicating that the
butter is sold in bulk and costs less per kilogram than the other
products.</p>
<p>The bottom part of the ad features a red banner with white text that
reads “SUPER CENA” and “Máslo 250 g, 1 kg = 155.60 Kč,” which suggests
that the butter is on sale for a special price of 155.60 CZK per
kilogram.</p>
<p>The overall theme of the advertisement is to highlight discounts and
sales on various food products, with a focus on meat seasoning mixes and
butter. The use of bold colors and large text is designed to catch the
eye of potential customers and convey the value of the sale.</p>
<p>*Uspora na měrné cené v porovnání s produktem ve standardné nabízené
velikosti.</p>
<p>The image shows a selection of products on sale at a grocery store.
The items include bottled water (Saguaro Grapefruit), mixed nuts (Alesto
Selection Mixed Nuts), and champagne (Burg Schöneck Sekt). There are
also discounts applied to the prices, with one bottle of water being
reduced by 30% and another bottle of champagne being reduced by 62.90%.
The text on the products is in Czech, indicating that this image was
taken in a Czech-speaking country or region. The sale items are
presented against a red background, which is common for promotional
materials to attract customers’ attention.</p>
<p>The image contains a logo that represents “Lidl,” which is a
well-known supermarket chain. The logo consists of the company’s name in
stylized blue letters, with a red dot replacing the ‘i’ in “Lidl.” This
design is consistent across various marketing materials and products
sold by Lidl. The image does not provide information about specific
products on sale or offers; it solely represents the brand identity of
Lidl.</p>
<p>The general store product on sale is a 100g bag of coffee, as
indicated by the text “Dusena šunka nejvysší jakości 100 g, krajená”
which translates to “The best quality coffee in a 100g bag.” The price
listed for this product is CZK 23.90, with a discount of -31%, meaning
the original price would have been CZK 34.90 (since 100% - 31% = 69%,
and 69% of CZK 34.90 equals CZK 23.90). The image contains text in both
English and Czech, with the discount percentage being highlighted in a
larger font size for emphasis.</p>
<p>The product on sale is Italat Mozzarella cheese, which is presented
as a traditional Italian variety. The packaging indicates that this
mozzarella is made from cow’s milk and is suitable for serving with
pasta dishes or other Italian cuisine. There are no visible prices in
the image provided, but the text on the package suggests it is marketed
towards consumers looking for authentic Italian food products. The use
of the term “traditional” implies that this mozzarella may be made using
a recipe or method that has been passed down through generations, which
could appeal to those who value traditional cooking methods and
ingredients.</p>
<p>The product on sale is Pikok Pure Dusena Sunka, which is a type of
ham. The packaging indicates that there are 100 grams of the product,
and it contains 95% meat. The text “Jedinecne slozeni” suggests that
this is a single-piece or single-cut product. The price is listed as CZK
100 per kilogram, which is equivalent to approximately USD 27.63 at the
time of the image’s creation. There are no additional texts or images on
the visible part of the label.</p>
<h2 id="do-neděle-27.-4.-od-čtvrtka-24.4.">DO NEDĚLE 27. 4. OD ČTVRTKA

<p>The general store product on sale appears to be Argus Neko Radler,
which is a type of citrus-flavored drink. The image contains text that
provides information about the product’s price and other details. The
price is listed as 10.60 CZK, with an additional offer of “2+1 ZDARMA,”
suggesting a promotional deal where customers can get two drinks for
one. There are also nutritional facts provided, indicating that each
drink contains 15.90 Kč and has a net content of 31.80 Kč. The text
mentions that the price is per kg, which implies that the product is
sold in bulk. Additionally, there’s a mention of “Cena za kus pfi koupi
každych 3 kusu v libovomé kombinaci 10,60 Kč,” which translates to
“Price for each kg of three cans in a combination of 10.60 Kč.” This
suggests that the product is sold at a discounted rate when purchased in
bulk.</p>
<p>The image contains a logo that represents “Lidl,” which is a
well-known supermarket chain. The logo consists of a yellow circle with
a red dot at the center, symbolizing the sun, and the letters “LIDL”
written in blue. This logo is used to identify the brand’s products and
services. There are no texts or prices visible in this image; it solely
features the Lidl logo.</p>
<h2 id="od-čtvrtka-24.4.">OD ČTVRTKA 24.4.</h2>
<p>The product on sale is a “Smart robotická sekacka 20 V” which
translates to “Smart lawn mower 20V”. It is priced at -2500 CZK, which
is equivalent to approximately 190 USD. The image also includes text
that provides additional information about the product: it has a maximum
cutting height of 3100 mm, a powerful motor for high performance, and an
integrated dust sensor. There are three-year warranty details mentioned
as well. The price is further discounted to -2500 CZK with a promotional
code “9999*“.</p>
<p>The image appears to be advertising a promotional event for Lidl, a
supermarket chain. The main focus of the advertisement is on a sale or
offer related to “34 Ocenění,” which translates to “34 Evaluations” in
English. This suggests that there might be a competition or contest
where customers can evaluate products and potentially win prizes. The
text also mentions that the evaluation will take place in 2024,
indicating that this is an upcoming event.</p>
<p>The advertisement encourages participation by stating “Proto máme
radost, že jsme v roce 2024 obdrželi ocenění v kategorích,” which
translates to “We hope we will win evaluations in categories in the year
2024.” This implies that customers have a chance to participate and
potentially win prizes.</p>
<p>The text also includes a call-to-action with the phrase “DĚKUJEME ZA
VASÍ PRIŻEN,” which translates to “We thank you for your prize.” This
suggests that there are multiple prizes available, and customers have
been selected as winners.</p>
<p>The image does not provide specific details about the products or
categories of evaluation, but it is clear that Lidl is promoting a
consumer engagement event where customers can participate in an
evaluation process to potentially win prizes. The use of bright colors
and bold text is designed to catch the attention of potential
participants and convey the excitement of the promotion.</p>
<p>The image provided does not contain any discernible text or specific
details that would allow for an accurate description of a general store
product on sale or offer. The image is purely abstract with no
identifiable features, colors, shapes, or symbols that could be
associated with a particular product or brand. Therefore, it is not
possible to provide a detailed answer regarding the content of the image
in terms of a general store product and its price.</p>
<p>The image provided does not contain any visible text or specific
details that would allow for an accurate description of a general store
product on sale or offer. The image is purely abstract with no
identifiable elements that could be associated with a retail setting,
such as shelves, products, or promotional materials. Therefore, it’s not
possible to provide a detailed answer regarding the specifics of a
product or its pricing based on this image.</p>
<p>The image does not contain any visible products for sale or offer. It
primarily features a logo with the year “1794” and the word “Thun,”
which could be part of a brand name or a company’s founding date. The
text is stylized in a way that suggests it may be related to a product,
but without additional context or visible products, it is not possible
to determine what specific general store product might be on sale or
offer based solely on this image.</p>
<p>The image shows a logo for “Lidl Plus,” which is a retail chain known
for offering discounted products. The logo consists of the company’s
name in stylized white letters against a blue background, with a yellow
circle containing the company’s emblem. The emblem features a red cross
and a blue dot, which are part of Lidl’s brand identity. There is no
visible text other than the company’s name within the logo itself. Since
the image does not provide any information about specific products or
their prices, it cannot be determined what general store product is on
sale or if there are any offers available in CZK (Czech Koruna).</p>

<p>The image provided does not contain any visible text or additional
context that would allow for an accurate description of a general store
product on sale or offer. The focus is solely on the plate itself, which
appears to be a standard white ceramic dinner plate with a decorative
blue line. Without further information or a broader view of the setting,
it’s not possible to determine if there are any other products available
for purchase in this store.</p>

appears to be a ceramic item with a simple design. Without further
information or a broader view of the setting, it’s not possible to
determine if there are any other products available or what they might
be. If this image were part of an advertisement or product listing, one
would typically look for text that describes the product, its features,
and possibly the price or promotional details. However, in this case,
such information is not discernible from the provided image.</p>
<p>The image provided does not contain any visible text or additional
information that would indicate a specific product or its price. It
solely features a stack of white plates with a blue design on them,
placed against a green background. Since there is no discernible text or

store product might be on sale or offer based on this image alone.</p>
<p>The image provided does not contain any visible text or additional

it’s not possible to determine what specific product might be associated
with this image or if there are any prices mentioned in CZK. To provide
an accurate description and answer your question, I would need an image
that includes text or additional context related to the sale of a
general store product.</p>

<p>The image shows a medal with text that suggests it is an award for
excellence, possibly related to sports given the trophy design. The text
on the medal reads “SUPER KUALITA ZA SUPER CENU,” which translates from
Serbian to “Super Quality for Super Champion.” This indicates that the
product being advertised is likely a high-quality item or service,
possibly related to sports equipment or services, and it is being
offered at a special price. The text is in capital letters, with “SUPER
KUALITA” being the most prominent feature of the medal’s design.</p>
<h2 id="za-super-cenu">ZA SUPER CENU *</h2>
<p>The image does not contain any visible text that specifies a
particular product or its price. The focus of the image is solely on the
variety of fresh produce displayed in the basket, which includes fruits
like bananas, apples, and oranges, as well as vegetables such as
broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. There are no discernible price tags
or indications of a sale or offer within this image. The setting appears
to be a promotional or artistic display rather than a commercial retail
environment.</p>

<p>The image contains text that appears to be in Czech language, which
translates to “ZDE NALEZNTE VSECHNY NASE VITEZE TESTU” from English.
This phrase suggests that the store is offering a test drive for all its
vehicles. The QR code above the text likely leads to more information
about this offer or possibly to a website where customers can learn more
or make an appointment for a test drive. There are no visible prices in
the image, and the focus seems to be on the promotional message rather
than specific product details.</p>
<p>The image displays a logo for the “BestBuy Award” which indicates
that the product featured on sale or offer is likely to be recognized as
a top-rated item, possibly within the category of electronics or
technology products. The text “BESTBUY AWARD” suggests that this
particular product has been evaluated and deemed to meet certain
standards set by BestBuy. The logo includes the year “2023/2024,” which
may imply a specific time frame for the award’s validity or
relevance.</p>
<p>The text within the logo is in Czech, as indicated by the language
used. The exact product cannot be determined from the image alone
without additional context or information about the specific category of
products that BestBuy Awards cover. However, given the nature of
BestBuy, which is known for electronics and technology products, it’s
reasonable to infer that the award could pertain to such items.</p>
<p>The logo does not provide explicit details about the product itself,
such as its name or model number. To obtain this information, one would
typically need to visit the official BestBuy website or contact their
customer service for more specifics on the products featured in the
awards.</p>

<p>The image contains a logo that represents “Lidl,” which is a
well-known supermarket chain. The logo consists of the company’s name in
stylized blue letters with a red dot replacing the ‘i’ in “Lidl.” There
is no text present in the image, and it does not depict any specific
general store product on sale or offer. The colors used are bright and
bold, which is typical for supermarket branding to catch the eye of
consumers.</p>

<p>The image shows a packaged food product that appears to be shrimp,
given their size, shape, and coloration. The packaging is predominantly
black with yellow text and graphics. There’s no visible brand name or
specific product details due to the angle and resolution of the image.
However, based on the context provided by the price tag in CZK (Czech
Koruna), which reads “200 g,” it can be inferred that this is a
commercial product likely sold in a grocery store or supermarket. The
text “200 g” indicates the quantity of the product contained within the
packaging, and the presence of the price tag suggests that this image
may have been used for an online listing or promotional material to
display the cost of the item.</p>
<p>The image shows a stack of raw beef slices with herbs sprinkled on
top, presented against a dark background which could suggest that they
are being displayed for sale at a grocery store. The product appears to
be fresh and is likely intended for culinary use, such as cooking steaks
or burgers. There is no visible text in the image that provides
information about the price or any other details regarding the product.
Since the image does not contain any discernible text, it’s not possible
to determine the exact price or any additional details from this image
alone.</p>

<p>The general store product on sale is “1 kg XXL MLETÉ MASO MIX 100%,”
which translates to “1 kg Extra Large Meat Mix 100%.” The meat appears
to be ground beef, and it’s garnished with herbs. There are two price
tags visible: one in CZK (Czech Koruna) for the regular price of 139.90,
and another in CZK for a reduced price of 139.90 after applying a 29%
discount, which amounts to 107.91 CZK. The text is clear and legible,
with the product name and prices prominently displayed against a
contrasting background.</p>
<p>chlazené, balené</p>
<p>The product on sale appears to be a type of meat roll or sausage,
possibly a traditional or regional specialty given its presentation and
garnishing. The text “650g” indicates the weight of the item, which is
650 grams. This suggests that the product is likely sold in bulk, as
indicated by the price per gram. The presence of the Czech flag could
imply that this product is either manufactured in the Czech Republic or
is being marketed to a Czech-speaking audience. Without additional
context, it’s not possible to determine the exact type of meat or its
origin, but the presentation suggests a focus on quality and traditional
preparation methods.</p>

price label in the image.</p>
<p>SUPER CENA!</p>
<p>The product on sale appears to be a type of meat, specifically red
meat slices that could be beef or pork based on their color and texture.
The text “SUPER CENA!” suggests that the product is being marketed as a
special offer or deal, possibly indicating a promotional price or a
brand name. However, without additional context or information about the
location where this image was taken, it’s not possible to determine the
exact nature of the sale or the currency in which the prices are listed.

well-known supermarket chain. The logo consists of the company’s name in
stylized lettering, with the letters “L” and “D” intertwined to form a
heart shape. This design is part of Lidl’s brand identity, which is
characterized by its bright colors and simple, bold typography.</p>

information about specific items that are currently available for
purchase at a Lidl store. The image does not contain any text other than
the company’s name in its logo form. Therefore, I cannot describe what

<p>The image shows a logo for “Prino,” which appears to be a brand name
associated with a product that is likely sold in general stores. The
presence of the wheat stalks suggests that the product could be related
to food, possibly bread or pasta. However, without additional context or
visible text specifying the product, it’s not possible to determine
exactly what “Prino” refers to. The logo design uses a simple and clean
font for the brand name, which is common in marketing materials to
convey a sense of reliability and quality. The use of the word “piece”
could imply that the product is sold in individual portions or as part
of a set. Since the image does not provide any information about prices
or specific products, it’s not possible to give a detailed description
of what is on sale or offer based solely on this image.</p>

“Jedinécny syr &amp; lomem” indicates that there is also a
single-colored syrup included in the product. The text “8 kusů 140 g”

to a bicycle race event, as indicated by the text “PRIPRAV SE ZAZIT RED

these companies are sponsors or partners in this event. There is no
mention of prices or specific products being sold; instead, it focuses
on the excitement and energy associated with the race.</p>

sausage given its round shape and the visible seasoning. The text “SUPER
CENA!” suggests that it is being offered at a special price, which is
not specified in the image but implied by the use of the word “super”
and the exclamation mark. The presence of herbs and red peppers as
garnish indicates an attempt to appeal to customers looking for
flavorful meat products. There are no visible prices or additional text

grilling or roasting, where fresh herbs are often added to enhance
flavor. There is no visible text in the image that provides information

not legible.</p>
<p>The image provided does not contain any discernible details that

and it contains 180 grams of the product. There are two jars displayed,

Spray Extra Virgin. It is a food item, specifically a condiment used to
add flavor to dishes. The label on the bottle indicates that it contains
olive oil and extra virgin olive oil, which are both derived from
olives. The product is likely marketed as a gourmet or specialty item
due to its presentation and the use of terms like “Extra Virgin” and
“Made in Spain.” There is no visible price tag on the bottle, but the
presence of a barcode suggests that it is for sale at a retail store.
The image does not provide information about any ongoing sales or
offers; it simply shows the product as it would be displayed on a
shelf.</p>
<p>The image shows two cans of beverages that appear to be soft drinks.
The can on the left has a label with “TARGA” prominently displayed,
followed by “FLORIO POMERANC,” indicating it is a floral pomegranate
drink. Below this, there’s additional text in Czech which translates to
“Targa Florio Pomeranč,” suggesting the flavor and possibly the brand
name or origin of the beverage. The can on the right has a label with
“ROYAL CROWN Cola” written in large gold lettering, followed by “1905,”
which could indicate the year of establishment or a significant date
related to the product. Below this, there’s text that seems to describe
the drink as “Gives every gentleman time to slow down and enjoy the
moment.” The price is not visible in the image provided.</p>
<p>The text on both cans suggests that these beverages are marketed
towards adults, possibly with a focus on health or wellness, given the
mention of “slowing down” and “enjoying the moment.” The use of Czech
language indicates that the product is likely targeted at a
Czech-speaking market.</p>

<p>The product on sale appears to be a “PARKSIDE” shower head with
integrated temperature control, as indicated by the text “s integrovanou
nádržkou na vodu” and the image of the shower head with a digital
display showing temperature. The price is listed as “-500 Kč,” which
suggests that it is being offered at a discounted rate. The product is
described as having a maximum flow rate of 4 liters per second, and
there’s an additional feature mentioned as “misci armatura,” which
translates to “armatured mixer.” The price is further reduced from the

indicating a 50% reduction. The text also mentions that this product can

<p>The image contains a logo that represents “Lidl,” which is a
well-known supermarket chain. The logo consists of the company’s name in
stylized blue letters with a red dot replacing the ‘i’ in “Lidl.” There
is no text present in the image, and it does not depict any specific
general store product on sale or offer. The colors used are bright and
bold, which is typical for supermarket branding to catch the eye of
consumers.</p>

equipped with an online ordering feature. The trimmer has a blade length
of 51 cm and a cutting height of 15 mm. The price listed on the

100.00 CZK, bringing the final price down to 699.90 CZK. This product is
being marketed as a “SUPER CENA!” (Super Price!), suggesting it is on

<p>The product shown in the image is a Parkside X-Force 12V cordless
drill. This type of tool is commonly used for driving screws into
various materials, as well as for removing them. The presence of a
digital display suggests that it may have features such as battery level
indication and possibly programmable settings or modes. The text “take
online” implies that the product is available for purchase online,
likely through an e-commerce platform. The CZK currency symbol indicates
that the price is in Czech koruna. However, without a clear view of the
entire label or additional context, it’s not possible to determine the
exact model number or specific features of this particular drill.</p>

<p>The image provided does not contain any discernible details that
would allow for the identification of a specific general store product
or any accompanying text. The symbol is generic and does not provide
enough context to determine what it represents, such as a brand logo, a
currency symbol, or an item from a store. Therefore, I cannot describe a
general store product on sale or offer based on this image. If you have
another image that contains the necessary details, please provide it so
I can assist with your request.</p>
<p>The image shows a red circular sticker with white text. The text
reads “5 LET,” which translates to “5 LETS” in English. This suggests
that the product is being offered at a price of 5 CZK, and it could be
referring to a quantity or a specific item within a store’s offerings.
Without additional context, it is not possible to determine what the
exact nature of the product is. The text does not provide information
about the product itself but rather indicates that there is a
promotional sale or discount being advertised for an item priced at 5
CZK.</p>
<p>“cena platna na lidl-shop.cz k 11. 4. 2025</p>
<p>The general store product on sale appears to be a variety of garden
hoses and related accessories. The advertisement is promoting a
“Sortiment na zavlazování” (assortment for watering), which includes
different types of hoses labeled A, B, C, and D. Each hose type has its
own specific function:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hose A is described as a “postrikovací,” meaning it’s a
post-tensioned hose, likely used for general gardening purposes.</li>
<li>Hose B is labeled as a “kulovy kohouek,” which translates to a
flexible hose, suitable for various watering needs.</li>
<li>Hose C is described as a “2cestný rozdelovací,” indicating it’s a
two-part system, possibly used for more complex watering tasks or for
connecting different hoses.</li>
<li>Hose D is labeled as a “nástrčný systém,” meaning it’s a flexible
system, likely designed for precise and controlled watering.</li>
</ul>
<p>The prices of the hose types are listed in CZK (Czech crown) with
decimal places divided by commas. The sale price for each type of hose
is 149.90 CZK for Hose A, 169.90 CZK for Hose B, and 279.90 CZK for Hose
D.</p>
<p>The advertisement also includes a promotional message in the upper
right corner that reads “OD ČTVRTKA 24.4.” This could indicate a special
offer or discount starting from April 24th at 12:44 PM, but without
additional context, it’s unclear what this refers to specifically.</p>
<p>The overall message of the advertisement is to promote these garden
hoses and accessories as part of a sale, with clear pricing and product
descriptions provided for each item.</p>

<p>The image contains a logo that represents “Lidl,” which is a

or additional details visible in the image that provide information
about specific products on sale or offers. The logo itself does not
contain any text, but it is a visual representation of the company’s

<p>The image appears to be a digital icon representing an IP44 rating
for a general store product. The “IP” stands for Ingress Protection,
which is a standard that indicates the degree of protection provided by
electrical equipment against intrusion from foreign bodies and
electromagnetic interference. The number 44 typically signifies a high
level of protection, suggesting that the product has been tested and
meets stringent safety standards.</p>
<p>The text “IP44” is clearly visible in white letters on a blue
background, which is a common color scheme for electronic devices and
equipment due to its association with technology and reliability. The
icon does not provide specific details about the product or the store it
pertains to; however, the IP rating implies that the product inside the
general store is likely to be durable and safe for use in various
environments, including potentially harsh conditions where such
protection would be necessary.</p>

<p>The image contains text that appears to be part of a logo or branding
for an online retailer. The text “Vzdy. Vice. Online.” is prominently
displayed, suggesting the name of the store or service. The use of Czech
language indicates that this is likely a Czech-speaking country or
region. However, without additional context or information about the
specific products on sale, it’s not possible to determine what general
store product is being advertised in the image. If there are prices
mentioned, they would be presented in CZK with decimal places divided by
commas as per standard currency notation.</p>
<p>The image provided does not contain any discernible details that
would allow for the identification of a specific general store product
or any accompanying text. The red swoosh is abstract and lacks any
identifiable features that could be used to determine what it
represents, such as branding or product type. Therefore, based on this
image alone, it is not possible to describe a general store product on
sale or offer nor to explain the presence of text in CZK with
prices.</p>
<p>The advertisement features various household items available for
purchase at a discounted price. The products include a pressure washer,
a vacuum cleaner, a lawn mower, and a folding chair. Each item is
accompanied by a promotional price in CZK (Czech crown), with some
prices highlighted in red to indicate special offers or discounts.</p>
<p>For example, the pressure washer is advertised at -800 Kč, which is a
significant discount from its original price. The vacuum cleaner is
priced at 799.90 Kč, and the lawn mower is listed at 2199.90 Kč. The
folding chair is marked down to 400 Kč, with an additional promotional
offer of -200 Kč off the original price.</p>
<p>The advertisement also includes text that provides information about
the products and their features. For instance, the vacuum cleaner is
described as a “massive bukové defevo” (large bucket vacuum), suggesting
its capacity to clean large areas efficiently. The lawn mower is noted
for its “3boodwy bezpečnostní pás” (three-blade safety blade),
indicating a focus on safety during use.</p>
<p>The advertisement also includes contact information and a website
link, presumably for customers to learn more about the products or make
purchases online. The overall presentation of the advertisement is
designed to attract customers with clear pricing, product features, and
promotional offers.</p>
<p>The image provided does not contain any visible text or details that
would allow for an accurate description of a general store product on
sale or offer. The photograph is too small to discern specifics, such as
the type of garment, brand, price, or any other relevant information.

<p>OD ČTVRTKA 24.4.</p>
<p>The general store product on sale is a Park Side cordless drill with
an attached circular saw blade. The advertisement highlights that this
tool is part of the “PARKSIDE” series, which is available at a
discounted price of 200 CZK. The drill features a Li-Ion battery with a
capacity of 2,000 mAh and a runtime of up to 270 minutes. It also has a

<p>The image provided does not contain any discernible details that

<p>The image provided does not contain any discernible information that
would allow for the identification of a specific general store product

yellow circle containing a red dot in the center, symbolizing the sun.
Below this, the word “Plus” is written in white capital letters on a
blue background.</p>
<p>The image does not contain any text that provides specific details
about the products available for sale or their prices. Since the price

<p>The image appears to be a sign for a general store product that is
currently on sale or offer. The main text “DOSTUPNÉ OD ČTVRKA” suggests
that the item is available from April 24th, and it will be sold until
further notice, ending on April 27th, 2025. The smaller text “VÁŠ KÓD:
LP17CT” likely refers to a specific product code or identifier for this
item. Below the main text, there is additional information in Czech that

<p>The product on sale is a pack of macarons from “Confiserie Firenze,”
which is likely a brand name for a confectionery company specializing in
these sweet treats. The packaging indicates that the product contains
144 grams, and there are two types of flavors available: green and pink.
Each macaron has a golden-brown crust with a creamy filling visible from
the side. The image also includes labels indicating that the product is

labels present, which include a green leaf symbol for organic products
and a red circle with a white ‘E’ inside it, likely representing an
allergy warning or a specific dietary requirement. The price is listed
as 144 CZK, but without additional context, the currency (CZK) cannot be
confirmed solely from this image.</p>
<p>The image shows a promotional sign for a product at a supermarket,
specifically from Lidl. The main offer advertised is a significant
discount of 28% on the price of an item, which is listed as “124.90
CZK.” This means that the original price would have been 124.90 CZK
multiplied by 100 to get the full amount before the discount was
applied. The sale price after the discount is 89.90 CZK, which is a
substantial reduction from the original price.</p>
<p>The sign also includes additional text that indicates the product’s
size and weight as “12 x 12 g,” suggesting that it is a small package of
some sort, possibly a food item or a household product. The presence of
the Lidl logo and the “-28%” signify that this offer is part of Lidl’s
promotional strategy to attract customers with substantial discounts on
various products.</p>

well-known supermarket chain. The logo consists of a yellow circle with
a red dot at the center, enclosed within a blue border. There is no text

provides information about the product’s brand, type, and price. The
brand name “Pilos” is prominently displayed at the top of the container,

show or recipe book, specifically focusing on a dish called “Rump steak
se zeleninovym” which translates to “Rump steak with green vegetables.”
The text is in Czech and provides detailed instructions for preparing
the dish. It includes ingredients such as rump steak, green vegetables,
and seasonings like salt, pepper, and herbs. There are also specific
cooking methods mentioned, such as “Príloha” (grilling) and “Pyre”
(roasting). The image does not show any general store product for sale
or offer; instead, it is a culinary advertisement with textual
information about the dish being prepared.</p>

<p>The image does not contain any visible text that specifies a general
store product on sale or offer. The focus of the image is solely on the
plate of food, which appears to be a gourmet dish rather than a
commercial product. Therefore, it’s not possible to determine from this
image if there are any products available for purchase at a general
store, nor can I provide information about prices in CZK or any other
currency.</p>
<p>The product on sale is “Irský Rump Steak,” which translates to “Irish
Rump Steak” in English. The steak is described as being chilled,
vacuum-sealed, and weighs 1 kg (479.60 Kč). It is currently priced at
119.90 CZK, with a promotional discount of -20%, which would reduce the
price to 83.90 CZK. The image also includes a small Irish flag and the
brand name “Hatherwood” in the top left corner, indicating that this
product is likely from Hatherwood meat stores or a similar retailer.</p>
<p>The general store product on sale is a bottle of “Powdered Strawberry
Syrup” with a volume of 0.7 liters. The syrup is priced at 26.90 CZK,
which is equivalent to approximately 3.15 USD based on the exchange rate

strawberry syrup also on sale, but their prices are not visible in the
image. The text “OVOCNÝ SIRUP” is prominently displayed at the bottom of
the advertisement, indicating that it is a type of fruit syrup.</p>
<p>The image shows a promotional advertisement for various food products
available at a supermarket. The main focus of the ad is on discounts
offered on different items. There are four canned goods displayed, each
with its own price and discount information.</p>

from the original price of 70.35 CZK to 59.80 CZK. The price is listed

since it’s not clear if this is a price per milliliter or another unit
of measurement.</p></li>

</ol>
<p>The advertisement also includes text that reads “LIDL CENOVÝ LÍDR
INFORMUJE,” which translates to “Lidl Price Information.” This suggests
that the prices listed are likely from Lidl, a supermarket chain known
for offering discounted products. The overall theme of the ad is to
highlight discounts on various food items available at Lidl.</p>
<p>The image appears to be a promotional graphic for a retail store,
specifically highlighting a sale or offer related to “LIDL” (which is a
brand name for discount supermarkets). The text “NÍŠI CENY KAŽDY DEN”
suggests that the prices are being reduced by one Czech crown each day.
The phrase “ZLEVNÚJEME” translates to “We will continue,” indicating
that this promotion is ongoing. The presence of a megaphone icon with
the text “LIDL CENOVÝ LÍDR INFORMUJE” implies that there may be
additional information or updates available about the sale, possibly
through a mobile app or website.</p>
<p>The image does not provide specific details about the products on
sale, such as their names or categories. However, given the context of a
discount supermarket, it is reasonable to infer that the items being
offered are likely everyday household goods or groceries typically found
in such stores. The promotional nature of the graphic suggests that the
store is encouraging customers to visit and purchase these items at
reduced prices.</p>
<p>The general store product on sale is Saguaro water bottles. The offer
includes a 5% discount on the regular price of 9.90 CZK, which would be
reduced to 9.45 CZK per bottle. This promotional price is highlighted in
a yellow banner at the bottom of the image. Additionally, there’s text
indicating that the product is available in a 1 liter size and that it
contains 6.60 kilograms of water. The bottles are labeled with various
fruit flavors such as Grapefruit, Pomegranate, Lemon, and Blackberry,
suggesting a variety of options for the consumer.</p>
<p>The image appears to be a promotional graphic for a television show
titled “Níži Čeny Každy Den,” which translates to “Lowest Prices Every
Day.” The text is prominently displayed in large, bold letters with
varying colors and sizes. Below the main title, there’s additional text
that seems to be an invitation or a call to action, possibly related to
a contest or giveaway, as indicated by the phrase “ZLEVNÚJEME” which
means “We will win.” The presence of the megaphone icon suggests that
this is likely part of a marketing campaign or advertisement.</p>
<p>The text is in Czech, and there are no visible prices in the image
provided. Since the image does not contain any specific product details,
it’s not possible to determine what general store product might be on
sale or offer based solely on this graphic. The focus seems to be on the
promotional message rather than a particular item for sale.</p>
<p>The general store product on sale is Solevita Orange juice from
concentrate. The image shows three different sizes of bottles with
orange juice, each labeled with the brand name “Solevita” and the flavor
“Orange.” There are also discounts advertised for each size: 21% off for
a 56-90 ml bottle, 8% off for a 57-90 ml bottle, and 9% off for a 49.90
ml bottle. The text on the bottles indicates that the juice is made from
concentrate and contains 100% fruit juice. The image also includes a
promotional price of 44.90 CZK for the 56-90 ml bottle, which is being
reduced to 49.90 CZK with the discount applied.</p>
<p>The image contains a logo that represents “Lidl,” which is a
well-known supermarket chain. The logo consists of the company’s name in
stylized lettering, with the letters “L” and “D” intertwined to form a
distinctive symbol. There are no texts or additional information visible
in the image that would indicate specific products on sale or offers.
Since the image is a logo and not an advertisement for individual items,
it does not provide details about what products might be available at
Lidl stores.</p>

<p>The image provided does not contain any visible text that can be read
or interpreted to describe a specific general store product on sale or
offer. The logo is the main focus of the image, and it appears to
represent a brand or company name rather than a product. Without
additional context or information, it’s not possible to determine what
type of product might be associated with this logo. If there are any
products available for sale at this location, they would likely be
indicated by text on signage or promotional materials that are not
visible in the provided image.</p>
<p>The image provided does not contain any visible text that would
indicate a specific product or its price. The logo suggests that it is
related to a brand or company, but without additional context or
information, it’s not possible to determine what general store product
might be on sale or the prices in CZK. To accurately describe the
product and its pricing, one would need either a clearer image of the
text or additional details about the product itself.</p>
<p>The image contains text that appears to be in Czech, which translates
to “Online Store Sale” in English. The specific product being advertised
is not visible due to the blurriness of the image provided. However,
based on the context given by the text, it can be inferred that the sale
likely pertains to items available for purchase online through a store’s
website or app. Without clearer visual information or additional
context, it is not possible to specify the exact nature of the products
being offered or their prices.</p>
<p>The image shows a section of a supermarket advertisement with various
food products on sale. The top part of the image features an individual
wearing a green apron, which suggests that they may be a store employee
or a representative of the brand. Below this image, there is a large
banner with text in Czech and English, indicating a promotional offer
for certain items.</p>
<p>The products on sale are predominantly food items such as pasta,
sauces, and other prepared goods. The prices are displayed in CZK (Czech
crown) alongside the discounted amounts. For example, one can see that a
jar of “Krúti/Kůreči Maso” is on sale for 13.90 CZK, which is a 26%
discount from its original price. Another item, “HELLO OVOČNÁ SVACINKA
VE SKLE,” is also on sale with a 21% discount.</p>
<p>The advertisement includes various other items such as “SEMOLINOVÉ
TĚSTOVINY SLUNĘCNICOVÝ KLEJI” (Semolino Pasta Slunecnicový Kleji), which
is priced at 36.90 CZK, and “INSTANTNÍ NUDLOVA POLEVKA,” which is on
sale for 248.90 CZK with a 15% discount.</p>
<p>The text in the advertisement provides additional information about
the products, such as their nutritional content and the fact that they
are made from natural ingredients. The overall tone of the advertisement
is promotional and designed to attract customers by highlighting
discounts on popular items.</p>
